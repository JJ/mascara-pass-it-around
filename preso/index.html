	  <aside class="notes">This is what coaches say when confronted by
    journalists after an adverse result. Football is filled with upsets,
    underdogs arriving to the semi-finals or even finals of cups, unknown teams
    performing much better than expected... Spain winning the world cup... It's
              a complicated gaming, with many events happening during 90 minutes.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">The coach needs to take a series of
      decisions on who needs to play and who should not, depending on the
      fixture; but also football fans need to know if their team is going to win
      or not. This match finished with 1-4 against Granada, which was the home
                team. Those are the ones with the white-red stripes.</aside>
